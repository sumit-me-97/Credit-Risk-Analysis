# Credit-Risk-Analysis



**Credit Risk Analysis Using Power BI**
This repository showcases my recent project where I conducted a comprehensive credit risk analysis using Power BI. This analysis is designed to assess the risk associated with lending and to identify key factors that influence loan defaults. Below, I'll outline the steps taken, key analyses performed, and some critical points covered in the project.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project was to evaluate credit risk by analyzing various borrower characteristics and loan attributes. By leveraging Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that provide insights into factors that contribute to higher default rates.

**Key Analyses**
1. Loan Grade Analysis
* Analyzed the distribution of loans across different grades.
* Identified which loan grades are more prone to defaults and the corresponding interest rates.
2. Interest Rate Impact
* Investigated how interest rates influence the likelihood of default.
* Visualized the correlation between higher interest rates and increased risk of default.
3. Borrower Credit History
* Assessed the impact of borrower credit history length on loan performance.
* Explored how borrowers with shorter credit histories tend to have higher default rates.
4. What-If Analysis
* Performed a what-if analysis to simulate how changes in interest rates might affect default rates.
* Created scenarios that help visualize potential risks under different economic conditions.
5. Demographic Analysis
* Examined the role of borrower demographics in predicting default likelihood.
* Included factors like age, income level, and employment status to assess their impact on credit risk.
6. Default Rate Calculation
* Utilized DAX calculations to accurately measure and visualize default rates.
* Implemented specific measures to correlate average loan amounts and interest rates with default rates.
